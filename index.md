## Brainstorming for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**Prompt 1:**
This quarter, we focused on making a new credit score. We looked at credit card transactions and used fancy computer methods like BERT to clean and sort the information. Our first try with these methods worked pretty well, getting an 88% accuracy. We want to make this even better by making our own special models. This shows how using computers to make better credit scores is really exciting!

**Prompt 2:**
For the second quarter project, I was interested in exploring new ways to improve credit scores. My goal is to investigate how different simple models and data preprocessing techniques affect the accuracy of credit score predictions. By experimenting with various algorithms, I hope to develop a more accurate credit scoring system. The investigation will focus on determining which factors in credit card transactions have a significant impact on the accuracy of a credit score.

**Prompt 3:**
One potential change for the current first-quarter project involves consolidating other data sources beyond the transaction descriptions. We can try to improve text preprocessing techniques to extract more meaningful information from transaction descriptions. Trying different machine learning models outside of BERT might improve accuracy. Finally, conducting a more in-depth analysis to identify specific transaction characteristics that strongly influence credit scores can improve the predictive model.

**Prompt 4:**
In this project, I wanted to integrate natural language processing techniques, specifically using simple models like TF-IDF to extract meaningful features from text data. Combining the NLP method with TF-IDF can provide an effective method for processing transaction descriptions for credit score modeling.
